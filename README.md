# Downloadalytics
A free PHP script for tracking file downloads in Google Analytics

If you're not PHP/Apache-savvy, [**Van Patten Media**](http://www.vanpattenmedia.com/) can install the script for you, for $200 per standard installation. [Get in touch](http://www.vanpattenmedia.com/) to learn more.

## Installation
Downloadalytics requires some basic setup:

1. Download the [Server Side Google Analytics](https://github.com/dancameron/server-side-google-analytics) class, and make sure to update the path in `download.php`
2. Set your Google Analytics property ID and domain name
3. Replace references to `your-site.com` with the proper domain name (if your downloads are hosted on a subdomain, you should also update the reference to `www` in the script)
4. Replace the `mp3` filetype with the type you want to track.

At this point, you're ready to go! URLs will be formatted as `http://your-site.com/download.php?url=http://your-site.com/path/to/download.mp3`.

You can also optionally set up the included `.htaccess` rewrite directives, to clean up the URLs.

The `.htaccess` rewrite assumes a few WordPress-y things:
*   It assumes your files are stored in a `wp-content/uploads` folder
*   It assumes your files are in year and date subfolders (the WordPress default; e.g. `your-site.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/file.mp3`)

The `.htaccess` will rewrite URLs formatted as `http://your-site.com/download/2014/01/file.mp3` to `http://your-site.com/download.php?url=http://your-site.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/file.mp3`. This is easy to modify with basic regex/rewrite experience.
